          <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
          <p>Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, 
            and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. 
            Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or 
            captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. 
            But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- 
            his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).

          <h3>Avatar</h3>
          <p>On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved. 
            Because the planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human 
            minds to allow for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, 
            becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). 
            As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.

          <h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
          <p>A middle-aged Chinese immigrant is swept up into an insane adventure in which she alone can 
            save existence by exploring other universes and connecting with the lives she could have led.
